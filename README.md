# Teaching-Repo
<p>I am taking some extra lessons on how to use git hub better </p>.<br>
Alot of things seem unclear to me as to how to commit a repository and link it up with my VS Code<br>
<p> I think I am more vast with coding now and opening it on live server,<br>
  where the challenge comes in is the linking of git hub to my vs code to create something meaningful for my website.<br>
  <p>However, I am certain that the more I practice, the better I will become</p>
